# Motion-Based Interface for Unity

The project aimed to create a virtual 3D object manipulation system using the MPU6050 sensor 
in conjunction with Unity. This chapter provides an overview of the system design, emphasizing the architecture that enables seamless interaction between the hardware components and software interfaces.


## Hardware components

ESP8266:
The ESP8266 is a key hardware component in the project, 
serving as a crucial link between the physical world and the 
digital environment. 

MPU6050:
The MPU6050 is a motion-tracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer in a single package.


## Lessons Learned

The project focused on creating a system for virtual 3D object manipulation by leveraging the MPU6050 sensor's rotational data. The integration of hardware components, including the MPU6050 sensor and ESP8266 module, with software interfaces such as Unity, showcased the versatility of bridging the physical and virtual realms.
